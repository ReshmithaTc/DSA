# 🧠 DSA Practice Repository

Welcome! This repository is dedicated to systematically solving **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA)** problems for interview prep (FAANG-style, product-based companies, and competitive programming).

The main goals:

- Build **strong fundamentals** in core DSA topics.
- Practice writing **clean, optimized code**.
- Maintain a **structured record** of solved problems.
- Track **progress over time**.
